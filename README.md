# Natural Gas Disruption Hook - Uniswap V4

A Uniswap V4 hook that creates market incentives for price convergence based on real-world natural gas prices using Flare Data Connector (FDC) oracles.

## Overview

This project implements a novel pricing mechanism where:
- **Misaligned traders** (pushing price away from theoretical) pay **high fees**
- **Aligned traders** (correcting price toward theoretical) pay **low fees** + receive **bonuses**
- Bonuses are funded by misaligned trader fees (self-sustaining)
- Creates profitable arbitrage opportunities that drive price discovery
- Uses **Flare Data Connector (FDC)** for decentralized, verifiable price feeds

## How It Works

### Example Scenario

**Setup:**
- Oracle theoretical price: $3.50 (based on real-world natural gas data via FDC)
- Pool price: $4.20 (speculation/FOMO)
- Deviation: 20% too high

**Trading Dynamics:**

| Trader Type | Action | Fee | Bonus | Net Result |
|------------|--------|-----|-------|------------|
| Seller (aligned) | Sells 1 NATGAS | 0.1% | +$0.17 | Gets $4.37 (ABOVE market!) |
| Buyer (misaligned) | Buys 1 NATGAS | 4% | None | Pays $4.37 (in quote) |

**Result:** Sellers are incentivized to sell, pushing price down toward $3.50. As price converges, incentives decrease to zero.

## Smart Contracts

### Deployed Contracts

#### NatGasToken.sol
- Standard ERC20 representing natural gas
- Symbol: **NATGAS**
- 18 decimals
- Mintable for testing

#### MockUSDC.sol
- Mock USDC for testnet
- 6 decimals (like real USDC)
- Includes `faucet()` function for easy testing

#### DisruptionOracle.sol
- **Powered by Flare Data Connector (FDC)** for decentralized price feeds
- Tracks real-world disruption events (for future iterations)
- Price calculation:
  - Base price updated via FDC attestations from external APIs
  - Disruption tracking available but not affecting price in initial iteration
  - Anyone can submit valid FDC proofs to update prices
- **Disruption types** (tracked but inactive in v1):
  - Supply shock
  - Demand shock
  - Weather events
  - Sanctions

#### Libraries

**FeeCurve.sol**
- Quadratic, linear, and exponential fee curves
- Scales fees based on price deviation
- Caps at maximum to prevent extreme fees

**BonusCurve.sol**
- Quadratic, linear, and sqrt bonus curves
- Calculates bonus rates for aligned traders
- Includes treasury-adjusted bonuses

### NatGasDisruptionHook.sol (In Progress)

Main Uniswap V4 hook that:
1. **beforeSwap**: Sets dynamic fee based on alignment
2. **afterSwap**: Pays bonuses to aligned traders from treasury

## Flare Data Connector (FDC) Integration

### What is FDC?

Flare Data Connector enables smart contracts to access off-chain data in a decentralized and verifiable way. Unlike traditional oracles, FDC:
- Provides cryptographic proofs of external API data
- Allows anyone to submit price updates (fully decentralized)
- Verifies data authenticity on-chain before accepting

### How We Use FDC

**Price Updates:**
```solidity
// Anyone can call with valid FDC proof
function updateBasePriceWithFDC(IWeb2Json.Proof calldata proof) external
```

- Fetches natural gas prices from external APIs (EIA, commodity markets, etc.)
- Proof is verified on-chain using Flare's verification contract
- Price must be fresh (< 1 hour old)
- Updates basePrice used for theoretical price calculations

**Weather Disruptions (Future):**
```solidity
// Tracks weather events but doesn't affect price yet
function setWeatherDisruptionWithFDC(IWeb2Json.Proof calldata proof) external
```

- Weather data from external APIs with severity rating (0-10)
- Verified via FDC attestations
- Infrastructure ready for future iterations

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or pnpm
- Git

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd ETHGlobalBuenosAires25

# Install dependencies
npm install
cd packages/contracts
npm install
```

### Compile Contracts

```bash
cd packages/contracts
npx hardhat compile
```

### Run Tests

```bash
cd packages/contracts
npx hardhat test
```

### Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Set environment variables
export PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
export BASE_SEPOLIA_RPC=your_rpc_url

# Deploy
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.ts --network baseSepolia
```

### Setup EIA API for FDC Integration

To feed real-time Henry Hub natural gas prices into the oracle:

1. **Register for EIA API key** (free, 2 minutes):
   ```bash
   # Visit: https://www.eia.gov/opendata/register.php
   # Save your API key to .env
   echo "EIA_API_KEY=your_key_here" >> .env
   ```

2. **Test the API connection**:
   ```bash
   cd packages/contracts
   npx ts-node scripts/fdc-integration/test-eia-api.ts
   ```

3. **View complete setup guide**:
   - See `scripts/fdc-integration/eia-api-setup.md` for detailed instructions
   - See `API_SOURCES.md` for alternative price sources

4. **Submit FDC attestation** (on Coston2 testnet):
   - Use the template in `scripts/fdc-integration/fdc-attestation-request.json`
   - See `scripts/fdc-integration/submit-fdc-proof.ts` for submission script

## Mechanism Details

### Fee Structure

- **Aligned traders**: 0.01% fee
- **Misaligned traders**: 0.3% - 10% (scales with deviation)
- **At equilibrium**: 0.3% base fee for all

### Bonus Structure

- **Maximum bonus**: 5% of swap amount
- **Scales quadratically** with price deviation
- **Zero bonus** when price = theoretical
- **Treasury-funded**: From accumulated misaligned trader fees

### Price Convergence

1. FDC updates theoretical price (e.g., $3.50 via external API proof)
2. Pool price diverges (e.g., $5.25 from speculation)
3. Sellers see 50% deviation → earn max bonuses
4. Arbitrageurs sell to capture bonuses
5. Pool price moves toward $3.50
6. Bonuses decrease as deviation shrinks
7. At $3.50: symmetric fees, no bonuses

## Disruption Types

The oracle supports multiple disruption types (infrastructure ready for future iterations):

- **SUPPLY_SHOCK**: Production disruptions (hurricanes, pipeline issues)
- **DEMAND_SHOCK**: Demand changes (winter demand spikes, seasonal shifts)
- **WEATHER**: Weather events affecting production/transport
- **SANCTIONS**: Geopolitical sanctions affecting supply

**Note**: In the initial hackathon iteration, disruptions are tracked but do not affect the theoretical price calculation. The price is based solely on FDC-verified external API data.
